1. Instructions

- replace any [...] with free text,
  and
- replace the [?] with an X if you have completed that stage,
- replace the [?] with an * if you have attempted that stage, but you know
  it doesn't work completely; document why you think it doesn't work, plus
  what you would do to fix the problem, at the end of the marksheet.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Information

So that we can calibrate and improve the assignment in the future, give us
a rough idea how long (in hours) you spent on it *in total*:

effort : stage 1 -> [20] hours
effort : stage 2 -> [20] hours
effort : stage 3 -> [...] hours
effort : stage 4 -> [...] hours

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. Citation

Clearly it might have an influence on your mark, but the use of third-party
resources *is* allowed *if* correctly cited (unless explicitly prohibited 
by the assignment description of course).  Let us know what third-party 
source code or resources you used (if any) so it's clear what's your work 
and what isn't:

4. Marking

The following gives a stage-by-stage description of the assignment marking
scheme.  Note this acts as an indicative guideline only, including weights
for each more obvious aspect (e.g., functional correctness); other aspects
outside this list can warrant an increase/decrease in marks, with examples
including hard to quantify features such as the efficiency, robustness, 
generality, realism, or style of a solution.

[X] Stage 1 : an attack based on error messages
              - correct challenge material                           ( 40%)
              - solution quality wrt. efficiency, robustness etc.    ( 30%)
              - analysis questions                                   ( 30%)

              challenge material (i.e., plaintext  m^{*}) : [B6562D3E8846C371DF369269A88ACF6E2A4692DD3CF8B9B1ECE4]

[X] Stage 2 : an attack based on execution time
              - correct challenge material                           ( 40%)
              - solution quality wrt. efficiency, robustness etc.    ( 30%)
              - analysis questions                                   ( 30%)

              challenge material (i.e., exponent   d^{*}) : [92319C502A2F137]

[?] Stage 3 : an attack based on an injected fault
              - correct challenge material                           ( 40%)
              - solution quality wrt. efficiency, robustness etc.    ( 30%)
              - analysis questions                                   ( 30%)

              challenge material (i.e., cipher key k^{*}) : [...]

[?] Stage 4 : an attack based on power consumption
              - correct challenge material                           ( 40%)
              - solution quality wrt. efficiency, robustness etc.    ( 30%)
              - analysis questions                                   ( 30%)

              challenge material (i.e., cipher key k^{*}) : [...]

                                                                     ------
                                                                     (400%)

5. Documentation

Any other documentation, notes or comments that you think are important or
might be easy to overlook (e.g., a subtle issue or technique in associated
source code) should go here:

[

The version of Go on the lab computers and equivalent is quite dated (2009, pre
1.0) and as such many common standard library functions and types are not
present. This has been mostly taken care of by implementing equivalents in
utils.go. The compiler is also still split into separate modules meaning
compiling multi package programs must be done manually. I have written a build
script `build.sh` which takes several go files, compiling each import file
individually with `6g`, then finally the main package by linking them together
with `6l` to create a final executable. Full compilation of both attacks can be
achieved with:

    `$ make all`

The Go package file structure of both attacks are as follows:

    ./oaep/attack.go ---- main oaep attack execution functions.
    ./time/attack.go ---- main time attack execution functions.
    ./pkg/oaep_c.go ----- helper functions for oaep config.
         /time_c.go ----- helper functions for time config.
         /command.go ---- wrapper for executing programs and writing/reading
                          from stdin/out.
         /montgomery.go - package for executing Montgomery calculations.
         /file.go ------- helper functions reading config files.
         /utils.go ------ a collection of utility functions for memory
                          management, bit and number manipulation. Mostly
                          needed since version of installed Go is old.

In an effort to decrease computation time for the timing attack, I have
increased the maximum number of CPUs go routines can execute on to 2. Although
tested on lab machines, if for whatever reason the program does crash due to go
routine errors, please comment out line 63 in time/attack.go:
`runtime.GOMAXPROCS(2)`. This will ensure a single CPU is used for computation.
